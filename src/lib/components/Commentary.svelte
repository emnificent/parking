  <p>I buy domains for my projects, but sometimes I change project names or abandon them, resulting in expiring domains. Too often, speculators acquire these domains at expiration and list them for exorbitant prices. Thus, I now try to sell my expiring domains to give others a chance to secure their desired domain for their projects.</p>
  <p>While my listings may be expensive, as I need to recoup what I spent on domains I let expire, I'm open to negotiate. If you have an interesting project idea and you're on a tight budget, send me a message, and if I like your idea, I'll offer you a discounted price and we'll proceed through escrow. I rather see a domain in use than on a speculator's store.</p>
  <p>Or you could gamble on the chance that speculators won't acquire the domain at expiration and try to register it then for a lower price. Though I never was able to register the domains I wanted before speculators did. Now, those domains are priced way too high. My advice would be to secure your domain now, but you do you.</p>
