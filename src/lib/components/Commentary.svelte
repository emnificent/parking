  <p>I buy domains for my projects, but sometimes I change project names or abandon them, resulting in expiring domains. Too often, speculators like HugeDomains snatch these domains at expiration and list them for exorbitant prices. Thus, I now try to sell my expiring domains to give people like you a chance to secure your desired domains, before speculators take advantage of you.</p>
  <p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: <a href="https://lustfulslut.com" target="_blank">lustfulslut.com</a> and <a href="https://lustess.com" target="_blank">lustess.com</a> are set to auto-renew, and won't expire.</p>
  <p><strong>Let's negotiate!</strong> You have an interesting project idea but you're on a tight budget? Send me a message, I'll offer you a discounted price if I like your idea, and we'll proceed through escrow. Try your luck, you never know, I'm open&#8209minded! And before you worry that I'll steal your idea: I already have waayyy too many projects, and I promised my partner I wouldn't start new ones, haha!</p>
  <p>But if you're a gambler, you could bet on the chance that speculators won't snatch the domain at expiration, and try to register it then for a lower price. However, you should know that I attempted just that in the past, and out of the many times I tried, I only managed to get the domain I wanted just once. And now, the domains I couldn't get are priced way too high, with no option to negotiate.</p>
